i want to implement compaction/memory (long and short term)/embeddings of memories with qmd search, also embeddings of docs. Check the /docs for more info what we have planned. Also check how it is handled in /inspiration/openclaw (pull first for latest version). I don't want to implement at once so break down int multiple logical steps and put those steps in a md file under /docs. (actually use a section under todo.md)
