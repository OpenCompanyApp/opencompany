now in the organization page i wan to make a "office visualization", it is currently trending on x where everyone shows a openclaw setup with multiple agents shown in a 2d visualized setup, i also something that is worth sharing and has viral potential, a cool org visualization way, integrated with tasks, models are visible etc. Suggest me some ways to visualize first.
