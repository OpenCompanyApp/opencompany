we have to keep a mapping somewhere of token limits per model, let's start for all the glm models and claude models.

--

relationship managers/agents below managers, Permissions???

---

in/out a2a

--

cost managemnt

--

imagine business use cases and this platform, -> recommendations, also doc

--

feedback modal + tool

--

adjustable embedding/summary/flush/reranking model

-- 

memory/privacy considerations


---

qmd with hybrid/reranking etc

--
 ok but for recall memory tool, we should also have the option to check the logs of a      
  specific date, without search. with custom truncation parameter options and a reject      
  feedback if too much tokens would be returned so the agent has to truncate if needed and  
  too much logs on that daty for example. so agent can choose between search or a           
  specific day.

  in task ui i also want to see how much % goes to what, like system prompt , convo         
  history. And in system prompt also to which identity file, how much to memory etc
